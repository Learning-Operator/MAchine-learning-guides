Things involved within Preprocessing include:\n","\n","- Handling missing data: Machine learning models require complete data, but real-world data is often incomplete.\n","\n","- Removing noise and inconsistencies: Data might have errors or outliers that could mislead the model.\n","\n","- Scaling and normalization: Features with different scales can negatively impact the model's performance.\n","\n","- Converting categorical variables: Machine learning algorithms require numerical inputs, so categorical variables need to be transformed.\n","\n","#####Scaling and Normalization\n","\n","- Min-Max Scaling: Scales features to a range (e.g., 0 to 1), especially useful for algorithms like KNN and neural networks.\n","\n","- Standardization (Z-score normalization): Scales features so they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n","\n","- Log Transformation: Converts skewed data distributions to a more normal distribution.\n","\n","- Box-Cox Transformation: A more complex transformation to normalize data.\n","\n","#### Encoding Categorical Data:\n","\n","- Label Encoding: Assigns a unique number to each category (e.g., \"red\" becomes 0, \"blue\" becomes 1). This works well for ordinal categories.\n","\n","- One-Hot Encoding: Converts each category into a separate binary column (e.g., a column for \"red\", \"blue\", etc.). This is suitable for nominal categories where the order does not matter.\n","\n","####Feature Engineering\n","\n","- Creating New Features: Sometimes, new features can be derived from existing ones.

For example, instead of assigning numbers to \"dog,\" \"cat,\" and \"bird,\" the encoder creates three columns: one for \"dog,\" one for \"cat,\" and one for \"bird,\" where a value of 1 represents the presence of that category and 0 represents its absence. This prevents the model from assuming any ordinal relationship between the categories.\n","\n","Documentation: https://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html"],"metadata":{"id":"_AgDN24Zjwe2"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder\n","\n","# Let us first create a dataframe of catagorical data and turn it into a dataframe\n","Words = {'Words': [\"Hospital\", \"clinic\", \"infirmary\", \"Urgency\", \"immediate\"]}\n","Words_df = pd.DataFrame(Words)\n","\n","# To use OneHotEncoder, we first need to initialize it.\n","# The reason we set \"sparse_output\" to false is because we do not want our sparse matrix  -- where a majority of its values are zero -- in a CSR format\n","Ohe = OneHotEncoder(sparse_output=False)\n","\n","# Fit and transform the data, this is a quick way for us to implement this encoder\n","\n","Words_Processed = Ohe.fit_transform(Words_df[['Words']])  #
